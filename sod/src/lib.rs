//! Sod: symmetric replication for fold apps.
//!
//! A **sod** is a replica: a local database that always accepts writes and
//! converges with its peers by exchanging what the other is missing. There
//! are no client or server roles on the wire — client↔server is a star of
//! pairwise symmetric sessions, p2p is any other graph of the same sessions.
//!
//! Convergence comes from algebra, not coordination: the write primitive is
//! a Z-set delta (datum + signed multiplicity), deltas commute, and views
//! are deterministic functions of the resulting multiset. Replicas that
//! hold the same set of frames hold the same views.
//!
//! Everything platform- or engine-specific enters through a port:
//!
//! - [`engine::Engine`] — "the bog machinery" that materializes deltas.
//!   [`engine::MemEngine`] is the always-compiled oracle;
//!   `FoldEngine` (feature `fold-engine`) wraps a fold `Stream`.
//! - [`store::LogStore`] — the append-only frame log.
//!   [`store::MemLog`] always; [`log_file::FileLog`] on filesystems.
//! - transports (feature `ws`) drive the sans-io [`sync::Session`].
//!
//! Design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-15-sod-design.md`.
